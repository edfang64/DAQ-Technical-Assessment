# Brainstorming
Part 1:
Could remove the unexpected curly bracket from the JSON message but that seems like a bandaid solution thats for this one specific case tbh

Can just have it send an error message and move on.


Part 2:


Part 3:
Added feature to frontend which allows for a smoother colour change of temperature value, looks weird when using the battery emulator values due to the sudden and random changes in temperature but should be fine when used with real temperature values since it hopefully wont go from like 4 to 400 degrees instantly . Unsure what else to add in terms of aesthetics.

Part 4:
Had a lot of trouble figuring it out from scratch, no idea where to even start. Did research through github docs and various youtube videos but ran out of time. Least i now know what a container is though.
